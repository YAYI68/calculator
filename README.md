## Overview
This project is a simple calculator application built using React. The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two numbers.

## Technical Choices
### React
React was chosen as the framework for this project due to its simplicity, flexibility, and popularity. React's component-based architecture makes it easy to create reusable UI components, which is ideal for building a calculator with distinct buttons and display components.

### Tailwindcss
Tailwindcss library was used for styling the calculator components. 

### State Management
React's built-in state management system was utilized to handle the state of the calculator. The current calculation expression, as well as the result, are stored in the component's state.

## Trade-offs
### Basic Functionality Only
This calculator project focuses on providing basic arithmetic operations. More advanced features such as parentheses for complex expressions, memory functions, or scientific calculations were intentionally omitted to keep the scope of the project manageable. Adding these features would increase the complexity of the codebase significantly.

## Future Improvements
Given additional time, several enhancements could be made to this calculator project:

Advanced Functionality: Implementing advanced features such as support for parentheses, exponentiation, square root, and memory functions would make the calculator more versatile.
Improved Styling: Enhancing the visual design and responsiveness of the calculator interface to provide a more polished user experience across different devices and screen sizes.
Localization: Adding support for multiple languages and localization would make the calculator accessible to a wider audience.
Accessibility: Ensuring that the calculator is fully accessible to users with disabilities by implementing proper keyboard navigation and screen reader support.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this calculator project demonstrates the basic implementation of a calculator application using React. While it provides essential arithmetic functionality, there are opportunities for further refinement and expansion to make it more feature-rich and user-friendly.
